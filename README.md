# Angular-Routes-Solo

In this assignment we will be using Angular Routes to display information on 3 fictional characters of your choice. Your page should have a header and footer of some kind, and 3 buttons to swap out the content of the characters.

Sample Characters

    Harry Potter (Harry Potter books/movies)
    Storm (X-Men)
    Frodo (Lord of the Rings)
    Samus Aran (Metroid)
    Indiana Jones (movies)
    Michonne (Walking Dead)

Feel free to use Google for the content, or make up your own! Include some images!
Hard Mode

Style your application with Bootstrap!
Pro Mode

Forget Bootstrap, use your own styles! Use a CSS reset for a clean slate first.
